Compound semiconductors such as GaN, SiN, and SiC are becoming increasingly important in silicon photonics, power devices, and automotive electronics due to their wide band gap, high thermal conductivity, and excellent optoelectronic properties. However, during growth and processing, these materials are susceptible to defects that disrupt crystal symmetry and local strain fields, thereby altering their properties and limiting device yield and reliability.

In this study, we use first-principles calculations to investigate the influence of defects on second harmonic generation (SHG), a nonlinear optical effect highly sensitive to crystal symmetry. Defects such as stacking faults or dislocations modify the nonlinear polarization tensor and SHG intensity, while strain variations further affect SHG characteristics, making it a promising non-destructive probe for defect analysis. Using GaN as the model system, we simulate strain distributions induced by defect structures, derive the second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor, and analyze the relationship between defect-induced symmetry breaking and nonlinear optical responses. The results provide useful understanding of defect effects on material properties and support the development of non-destructive defect characterization methods.
